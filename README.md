# Cloud Kitchen Analytics Dashboard
Welcome to the Cloud Kitchen Analytics Dashboard repository! This repository contains a collection of powerful analytics dashboards designed specifically for multi-location, multi-brand cloud kitchen networks. These dashboards provide insights and tools to track, manage, and optimize sales performance, product trends, and customer behavior in the cloud kitchen industry.

## Dashboards Included
### Sales Dashboard
The Sales Dashboard allows you to track and manage your sales across multiple locations and brands. It provides a comprehensive view of your sales performance, including comparisons of current sales, order quantity, and average order value (AOV) against your targets. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Day-over-Day (DOD%), Week-over-Week (WOW%), Month-over-Month (MOM%), and Year-over-Year (YOY%) changes in sales are calculated using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX), giving you valuable insights into your sales trends and patterns.The Sales Dashboard also includes a treemap that visualizes the percentage of sales by the top 10 food item categories. The dashboard offers daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly insights. To navigate through these different time frames, a format button is provided to select the desired duration.

### Product Trend Dashboard
The Product Trend Dashboard enables you to analyze the top-selling items in your cloud kitchen network. You can visualize the sales trends of the top 20 items, track item quantity trends, and gain insights into customer behavior and loyalty. The dashboard includes interactive filters for location, brand, date range, week number, and food item slicer, allowing you to customize your analysis and focus on specific data subsets.

### Customer Performance Dashboard
The Customer Performance Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of customer-related metrics. You can track the total number of customers over time, analyze new customer acquisition, evaluate customer retention rates, and calculate metrics such as customer acquisition rate and customer retention rate using DAX formulas. The dashboard includes a line chart to visualize daily total customer growth and monthly repeat customer growth. Additionally, a donut chart displays the distribution of customers by sales channel for a selected period. Users can further filter the dashboard based on one or multiple food items to gain insights specific to those items.
